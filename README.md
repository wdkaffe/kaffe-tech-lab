# Kaffe Tech Lab ☕️⚡️

> *"Where precision brewing meets high-performance engineering."*

Welcome to the **Kaffe Tech Lab**, the digital sanctum of **Kaffe Master**. This repository serves as the technical backbone for our specialized brewing station—a space where the soul of a specialty coffee barista converges with the rigor of a software engineer.

## ☕️ The Barista: KaffePro
At the heart of the lab is **KaffePro**, a futuristic Cyber Barista. Stationed behind a **Victoria Arduino Black Eagle Maverick** and guarded by **Mahlkönig EK43 S & E80 Supreme** grinders, she ensures that every extraction is as flawless as a clean commit.

## 🍱 The Kaffe Tech Dashboard
The lab's portal is a high-performance **Bento Grid Dashboard**, crafted with:
- **Next.js 15** for reactive telemetry streaming.
- **Tailwind CSS** for a minimalist "Kaffe Tech" aesthetic (Pure White & Stone Grey).
- **Framer Motion** for animations inspired by coffee blooming and fluid dynamics.
- **Circuit Blue** (`#00D1FF`) accents representing the lab's neural network.

## 📊 Live Telemetry
We don't just brew; we monitor. The dashboard fetches real-time parameters from `data/brew.json`, tracking:
- **Precise Temperature** (Target: 92.5°C)
- **Extraction Flow Rates**
- **Yield Precision** (Target: 36.2g)
